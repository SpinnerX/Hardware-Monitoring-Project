# Hardware-Monitoring-Project
For this project, we will utilize ML prediction models for predicting hardware failures.


### Installation Guide

### Windows
* Do the following pip commands, and if those do not work, do the following commands below
`pip3 install pyqt5` - If this doesn't work, then do the following line below
`sudo apt-get install python3-pyqt5` - Only if your using WSL

### Linux
* Do the following pip commands, and if those do not work, do the following commands below
`pip3 install pyqt5` \
`pip3 install python-psutil`
`sudo apt-get install python3-pyqt5` - Same way in installing in Linux
`sudo apt-get install python3-psutil`

### Mac (Apple)
* Do the following pip commands, and if those do not work, do the following commands below
`pip3 install pyqt5` \
`pip3 install python-psutil` \
`brew install python-pyqt5` \
`brew install python-psutil`

### Idea
- The idea for this project was to handle and to predict when hardware failure
- Areas that can be utilized this software would robotics, electrical and control systems.
- Hardware failure prediction is supposed to allow us to be isolate when a failure occurr happens \
    in the hardware level.
- Allowing us to prevent any loss in productivity.
